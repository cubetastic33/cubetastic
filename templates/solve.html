  <h2>Solving a cube</h2>
  <p>
    The Rubik's cube was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik. It took him one month before he was
    able to solve the Cube for himself. From then on, people all over the world were 
    wondering how to solve the cube â€“ even if it was possible. Of course, it was. The best speed cubers (people who take part in
    speed cubing - a sport where competitors try and solve the cube as quickly as possible) can solve the cube in under 6 seconds. There are
    many methods to solve the cube. In most methods, we solve it layer-by-layer.

  <p>
    In a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of a different colour: white, red, blue, orange, green,
    and yellow. In most currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, orange is opposite red, and the red, white,
    and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement. Many varieties of this puzzle are there, with various numbers of sides,
    dimensions, and stickers, but not all of them are by Rubik's.

  <h2>Algorithms</h2>
  <p>
    A memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube is called an
    algorithm. This word is derived from the mathematical use of algorithm, meaning a list
    of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, to a
    desired end state. Most methods of solving the Rubik's Cube have their own algorithms.
    They consist of notations, which tell the cuber what moves have to be done.

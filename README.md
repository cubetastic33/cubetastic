## Cubetastic Web Timer

Cubetastic Web Timer a PWA, which means you can add it to your homescreen and use it like an app (even when offline) without going to the play/app store or software center! It's cross platform, and works on both mobile and desktop. For instructions on installing the PWA on your device, click [here](https://cubetastic.herokuapp.com/installpwa).

The main features of this timer are:
+ It uses TNoodle scrambles.
+ It uses indexed DB for storing your solves if you're signed out, and if you're signed in to an account, it stores them in a server, so you can access your solves across all devices! You just need to sign in to the same account, and your times will automatically sync.
+ You can seperate your solves into sessions, and rename the sessions the way you want.
+ It saves the date and time of your solves
+ Analyze best, worst, and current averages & singles.
+ Find the average of virtually any number of solves
+ Scrambles are supported for almost all the WCA puzzles.
+ Follows Material Design.
+ High level of customization - you can make it look the way you want!
+ Inspection is in Beta now, so it is disabled by default. To enable it, go to the settings menu. (Note: there might be bugs, as it is still in Beta). Please inform me of any bugs you find, in the [contact me](https://cubetastic.herokuapp.com/contactMe) page of the website!

However, please note that the TNoodle scrambles for bigger puzzles like 4x4, 5x5, etc. can take some time to generate. If you have any queries, or feature request, or feedback, please tell me in the [contact me](https://cubetastic.herokuapp.com/contactMe) page of the website.

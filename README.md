## Cubetastic Web Timer

Cubetastic Web Timer a PWA, which means you can add it to your homescreen and use it like an app (even when offline) without going to the play/app store or software center! It's cross platform, and works on both mobile and desktop. For instructions on installing the PWA on your device, click [here](https://cubetastic.herokuapp.com/installpwa).

The main features of this timer are:
+ It uses TNoodle scrambles.
+ It uses indexed DB for storing your solves if you're signed out, and if you're signed in to an account, it stores them in a server, so you can access your solves across all devices! You just need to sign in to the same account, and your times will automatically sync.
+ You can seperate your solves into sessions, and rename the sessions the way you want.
+ It saves the date and time of your solves
+ Analyze best, worst, and current averages & singles.
+ View a graph of your solves to see how you're improving
+ Find the average of virtually any number of solves
+ Scrambles are supported for almost all the WCA puzzles.
+ Follows Material Design.
+ High level of customization - you can make it look the way you want!
+ You can choose to have inspection time!
+ Add reminders that can help you during your solves (like for bld solves, you can set a reminder when you want to finish memorising)

However, please note that the TNoodle scrambles for bigger puzzles like 4x4, 5x5, etc. can take some time to generate.
